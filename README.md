# ENES246 Digital Electronics at Howard Community College
## Contains programming exercises that are done with verilog, vivado and Nexys4DDR boards
### Workflow starts with examples. You are then asked various things to do with the examples in the form of tiny project. 
### Writing testing code is not the focus of this class. Testing itself will start off manual, move through some generic, simple testing verilog code and the gradually turn into a discussion so the issues are well known and are prepared for a testing class.  
### Will learn to work with modules both creating them and using them.  
### Final goal is to write RTL code looking at port interface diagrams and FSM and ASM diagrams, separating data from control.  

#Deliverables: 
####Write in lab notebooks when ever frustrated for more than 10 minutes attempting to do something. 
and create single electronic file of vivado screen shots plus specific new files generated. 
####Turn one frustration per week into an entry in a knowledge database (formatted as a spreadsheet).
####Create a word document containing RTL, Sythesis and Implementation screens captured from example extensions
####Create port interface, FSM and ASM drawings for the example extensions
####Discuss testing in terms of 2^n, and how to test the insipred project using the hardware of the Nexys4DDR boards
