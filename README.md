# ENES246 Digital Design at Howard Community College, a first course in digital electronics

## Contains programming exercises that are done with verilog, vivado and Nexys4DDR boards
### Workflow starts with examples. You are then asked various things to do with the examples in the form of a tiny project. 
### Writing testing code is not the focus of this class. Testing itself will start off manual, move through some generic, simple sv testing and the gradually turn into a discussion so testing issues are well known. 
### Will learn to work with modules both creating them and using them.  
### Final goal is to write RTL code looking at port interface, FSM, and ASM diagrams, separating data from control.  

# Deliverables:   
Write in lab notebooks in the goingToDo, Doing, Rant style keeping track of time. Rant and whenever frustrated for more than 10 minutes attempting to do something. Turn one frustration per week into an entry in a knowledge database (formatted as a spreadsheet).   

Create a single electronic file containing the tiny vivado project, and a word document containing the following:  
a) RTL, Synthesis and Implementation schematic (and others) screen shots of the tiny project  
b) Port interface, FSM and ASM drawings for the tiny project   
c) Discuss testing in terms of 2^n, and how to test the insipred project using the hardware of the Nexys4DDR boards   
  
Look at the README.md in each lab folder for tiny project instructions.
