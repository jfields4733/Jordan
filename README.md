# ENES246 Digital Electronics at Howard Community College
## contains labs that are done with verilog, vivado and nexys4ddr boards
### The overall workflow is start with some examples, get inspired, create something. 
### Along the deliverables are vivado projects, port interface diagrams, FiniteStateMachine (FSM) diagrams and Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) diagrams
### Writing testing code is not the focus of this class. Testing itself will start off manual, and the gradually turn into a discussion so the issues are well known and are prepared for a testing class.  
### Will learn to work with modules both creating them and using them.  
### Final goal is to be able to look at port interface diagrams.  

Lab Deliverables: Students write in lab notebooks when ever frustrated for more than 10 minutes attempting to do something. 
and create single electronic file of vivado screen shots plus specific new files generated. 

Labs start by following the outline of ![digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) component library.  
This means the labs start with gates, move through wires, plexers, flipflops, arithmetic and like digital end in miscellaneous projects.

There are readme files in each of the folders, and within these folders. Get Started!
