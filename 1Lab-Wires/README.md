# ENES246 Lab 1
## Going through the gate primitives, comparing RTL verilog with digital verilog 
### Follow and work inside this folder hiearchy using the same folder names. 
### Preserve this folder name and hiearchy using GitHub or zip files with HCC google drive
# Instructions for all labs in this folder
## 1. Write the steps you are using to figure out how to manually test the bit file with the Nexys 4 DDR board 
## 2. Write about the test you performed and the results in your engineering notebook. 
## 2. Create a Vivado project using the RTL code.
## 3. Capture screen shots of the circuits built by Vivado with the RTL code.
## 4. Re-Create the project in the Digital folder using digital software, 
## 5. Export the digital project to verilog code, build and test in a separate folder named VivadoDigital  
## 6. Capture screen shots of the RTL, Synthesis and Implementation reports that Vivado creates in both projects in a word file.  
## 7. Compare the digital circuit Vivado creates with the RTL circuit created.  
## 8. Write in words and hand drawings in your engineering notebook the differences.   
## 9. Look at the README.md file for the individual lab for additional instructions.
