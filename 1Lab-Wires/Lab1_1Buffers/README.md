# Lab1_1Buffers  
## Start with testing the bit file in the RTL folder. Write about your test steps and the result.   
## All future labs will have just a verilog file and xdc file in the RTL folder.   
## All other folders will be empty including digital, VerilogRTL and VerilogDigital folders.  
  
## Pick up again at step 5 as described for all the labs in 1Lab-Logic folder.   
## These are your additional questions to answer by building vivado projects in new folders you name:  
### How many LED's can one switch drive before the LED's dim?   
### Hint: You will need to figure out how to use the splitter under wires in digital .. or edit the verilog code directly.  
### What error messages do you get in digital and vivado when you try to drive one LED with two switches?
