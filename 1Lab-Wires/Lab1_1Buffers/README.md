# Lab1_1Buffers  
## Download the word document and look at the RTL, Synthesis and Implementation screens
## Open the vivado project and go through synthesis, implementation and generation of the bit file
## Send the bit file to the Nexys4DDR board and test the switches

## TinyProject1_1a Two switches can not drive one LED
## Look at the verilog code and the constraints file
## Make modifications so that two switches try to drive multiple LED's
## What are the vivado error messages? Where does vivado fail? Synthesis, Implementation or Bit File Generation?

## TinyProject1_1b One switch can drive multiple LED's
## Look at the verilog code and the constraints file
## Make modifications so that one switch drives mutliple LED's
## How many LED"s can one switch drive ... what fails ... do the LED"s go dim or does vivado eventually generate an error message?
