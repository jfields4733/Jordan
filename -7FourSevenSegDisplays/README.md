[Resource Utilization](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Implementation/Vivado-utilization-report/td-p/317517) forum question and answer. 

### Ethics of Different Institutional Objectives

There are three groups of Engineers with different objectives:

1. Engineers work for vendors .. For example Engineers work to improve Xilinx hardware FPGAs and Xilinx Vivado software to use them.
2. Engineers work for commercial/defense companies. Some use Xilinx. Others use Xilinx's competition. 
3. Engineers work for educational institutions. They teach and create open source, public, free tools for their doctorate degrees. Their students build circuits with a variety of tools. 

*Describe one area where these three different institutions conflict.* 

*Describe where the FPGA companies like Xilinx and the open source world conflict.*

*In what way are engineers removed from their employer's competing goals and more free to work together in standards committees?*

*What does an engineer represent ... like a lawyer representing clients, doctors representing patients?*

*What motivates all three groups of engineers to start cooperating and working together building a common standard such as the next version of Verilog?*

*Why has the [US supreme court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/435/679/) ruled that engineers from competing companies meeting and forming organizations is not price fixing, is **not** [anti-competitive collusion](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/435/679.html)?*
