# LotsOfGates
Vivado turns all circuits into the primitives of a CLB Slice: LUTs, muxes, adders, xor gates, d flip flops. Understanding these is the goal of this course. We have covered XOR gates.  The goal of this lab is to understand LUTs. 

The goal here is to predict [LookUpTables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) (LUTS) values.
Then find their contents in Vivado and compare.
Then look at how Vivado deals with identical circuits. 

## Project_1

Here is a gate diagram done in [logisim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/) that builds two identical circuits .. one is efficient ... and one uses lots of gates.  This is what was being stared at when the verilog code for project one was written.

## Project_2

Develop two identical circuits with 3 inputs, 2 outputs and at least 5 gates. The second circuit can be the most simple version of the first.  Then repeat the instructions of project 1. 

## Ethics

EDIM captures a battle between engineers trying to use tools like Vivado and engineers designing Vivado. They both have to make money. *Read this wikipedia article on [EDIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIF) and summarize in less than 200 words:*
