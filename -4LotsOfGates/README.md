# LotsOfGates
Vivado turns all circuits into the primitives of a CLB Slice: LUTs, muxes, adders, xor gates, d flip flops. Understanding these is the goal of this course. We have covered XOR gates.  The goal of this lab is to understand LUTs. 

The goal here is to predict [LookUpTables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) (LUTS) values.
Then find their contents in Vivado and compare.
Then look at how Vivado deals with identical circuits.

## Project_2

Develop two identical circuits with 3 inputs, 2 outputs and at least 5 gates. The second circuit can be the most simple version of the first.  Then repeat the instructions of project 1.
