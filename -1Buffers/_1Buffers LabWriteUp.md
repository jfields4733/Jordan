# Buffers LabWriteUp

There are three circuits in this lab. This is the form for the lab write up, repeated three times. You are to put a drawing (created with draw.io) you make for Port Interface. RTL Analysis, Synthesis, Implementation are vivado screen shots. Under testing there are three sections to be addressed with words: 
​	what all the possible situations are that need testing
​	what subset of all possible situations a practical realistic automated test could test
​	what can be tested by hand
