# Buffers and Voltage Controlled Buffers 
There are three folders containing three vivado projects.  In this lab and all other labs, you will be asked to demonstrate each circuit to an instructor, answer the questions (look up the answer online or make a hypothesis). Suggest you edit this readme file. 

## Buffers

Create a markdown file with Typora with screen shots of the RTL, Synthesis and Implementation schematics. 

*What is a net?*     
*What is a cell?*  
*What is an IO port?*  
*What do the yellow triangles labeled OBUF do?*  
*What physically is a zero?*  
*What logically is a zero?*  
*What physically is a one?*  
*What logically is a one?*   

Send the bit file to the Nexys4DDR board and show it working to your instructor.

## MultipleLEDs  
Look at the verilog code and the constraints file.  
Make modifications so that one switch drives mutliple LED's.  
*How many LED's can one switch drive?*  

*If vivado fails, where does it fail (RTL. Synthesis, Implementation or Bit File Generation), what is the error message?  What does the error message mean in your own words?*

*Instead of 16 lines of verilog code, everything can be put in one line. What is this one line?*

## MultipleSwitches

This project or circuit fails. Two switches can not drive one LED.  

*What are the vivado error messages?  Guess what each means in your own words.* 

*How do the net, cell, IO ports change?* 

*Does vivado fail during RTL Analysis, Synthesis, Implementation or Bit File Generation?* 

*What does the error message multi-driven net mean? What would you look for as an error in your circuit design? What is a multi-driven net?*

Hook the switches to the LED's in some creative way of your choice using the concepts you learned in this lab.
