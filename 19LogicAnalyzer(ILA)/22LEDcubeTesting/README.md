# Buffers  
 Download the word document and look at the RTL, Synthesis and Implementation screens.  
 Open the vivado project and go through synthesis, implementation and generation of the bit file.  
 Send the bit file to the Nexys4DDR board and test the switches.  

## TinyProjecta Two switches can not drive one LED  
Look at the verilog code and the constraints file.    
Make modifications so that two switches try to drive multiple LED's.  
What are the vivado error messages?  
Does vivado fail at RTL Analysis, Synthesis, Implementation or Bit File Generation?  

## TinyProjectb One switch can drive multiple LED's  
Look at the verilog code and the constraints file.  
Make modifications so that one switch drives mutliple LED's.  
How many LED"s can one switch drive? .. all 16?  
If vivado fails, where does it fail (RTL. Syntehsis, Implementation or Bit File Generation), what is the error message?  

## Deliverables
Submit a word file answering the TinyProjecta questions, the vivado project files for TinyProjectb 
and a word document with screen shots for TinyProjectb similar to the example. Answer these questions
associated with the screen shots, underneath the appropriate screen shot:
What is a net?
What is a cell?
What is an IOport?
What do the yellow trangles labeled OBUF do?
