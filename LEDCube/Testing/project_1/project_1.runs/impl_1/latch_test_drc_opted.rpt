PLCK-12#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets clk_IBUF] >

	clk_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to M13
	clk_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT LEDBlue_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
LEDBlue_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT gate2[0]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
gate2_reg[0], gate2_reg[0]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[1], gate2_reg[1]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[2], gate2_reg[2]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[3], gate2_reg[3]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[4], gate2_reg[4]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[5], gate2_reg[5]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[6], gate2_reg[6]_lopt_replica, gate2_reg[7] (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>
