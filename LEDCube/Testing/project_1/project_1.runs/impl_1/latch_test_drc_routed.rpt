2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gate3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin LEDBlue_i_2/O, cell LEDBlue_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net new_pwm[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin new_pwm[7]_i_1/O, cell new_pwm[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT LEDBlue_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
LEDBlue_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT new_pwm[7]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
new_pwm_reg[0], new_pwm_reg[1], new_pwm_reg[2], new_pwm_reg[3], new_pwm_reg[4], new_pwm_reg[5], new_pwm_reg[6], new_pwm_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>
