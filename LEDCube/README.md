The two folders in my LEDCube folder have the top-down modules of the Logisim file in the LEDCube6 file. I just have the I/O connections from eightPlanes to onePlane to DeMux. At DeMux, I started coding the what would've been the instantiation to incorporate the Latch module. I have completed the Latch module from Logisim in Vivado and that final product is located in the testing file inside the LEDCube file.

The Latch module works exactly as the Logisim file works, but with a relatively slow clock (2 counts per second) for logic testing.
