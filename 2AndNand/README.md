## AndNand
Download the word document and look at the RTL, Synthesis and Implementation screens.   
Open the vivado project and go through synthesis, implementation and generation of the bit file.  
Send the bit file to the Nexys4DDR board and test using the switches.  

## TinyProjecta can not build NAND from AND gates
A Nand gate's output is the negative of an And gate. 
Switch the NAND gate to an AND gate.  Test.  
Try to build a Nand gate with And gates.  
What is the name of the math class that will prove this is impossible?
What possible departments is this math class offered in? 

## TinyProjectb can build AND with two NAND gates
First create a not gate using one NAND gate. Then not the output of the original NAND gate.   
The final verilog code is going to have two NAND gates in it.   

## Deliverables
Submit a word file answering the TinyProjecta questions, the vivado project files for TinyProjectb and a word document with screen shots for TinyProjectb similar to the example. In the word document, comment on how the symbols in the RTL analysis, the Sythesis schematic and Implementation schematic differ from the circuit visualized in the verilog code.
