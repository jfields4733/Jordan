We start with projects doing something associated with computer science called Modular Arithmetic and build circuits to help us learn Mod addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.  Read this [Khan Academy introduction to Modular Arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) and go through the first practice.  Then will graduate to LED patterns.

## Mod 2
Mod 2 is also called parity. The goal is to look at the use of the case command. Why isn't the increment put into the control loop? Our goal now is to only look at the RTL schematic. Not how synthesis is changing it. Not how the circuit is implemented within the FPGA.

## Mod 3

This incrementally the same as Mod 2. Can we generalize for Mod n? As you read the code, identify which numbers need to be changed into a variable that could come from switches. 

## Mod N

Ok, this is a generalized version of a mod.
